40 toneladas métricas por persona. Esto puede reflejar un nivel de industrialización más alto y una mayor dependencia de combustibles fósiles en estas regiones. En el caso de Asia Oriental y Pacífico muestra un incremento significativo en las emisiones por persona a partir del año 2000, lo que podría estar relacionado con el rápido desarrollo económico e industrial de países como China.  Asia del Sur y África Subsahariana presentan las emisiones más bajas por persona, lo que podría indicar una menor industrialización o una infraestructura energética menos dependiente de los combustibles fósiles. Sin embargo, hay que notar el aumento en Asia del Sur después del 2000.por  ultimo, Oriente Medio y Norte de África muestran una variabilidad notable, con algunos años experimentando emisiones muy altas por persona, posiblemente debido a la producción de petróleo y gas en estos lugares."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-02T19:04:17.961826Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-02T19:04:17.961435Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-02T19:04:21.537252Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-02T19:04:21.536383Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-02T19:04:17.961793Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.plotly.v1+json":{"config":{"plotlyServerURL":"https://plot.ly"},"data":[{"hovertemplate":"<b>%{hovertext}</b><br><br>region=South
